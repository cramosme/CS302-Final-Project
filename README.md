      As this was our first meeting everybody was present. We discussed what kind of game we would make and what attributes the game
      would have. We decided to make a single-player puzzle escape game. Everybody was tasked with getting familiar with Unity. We made a rough outline of what puzzles we would include in the game and played similar titles to see what we could do for our game.
