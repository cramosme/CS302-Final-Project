Report of How This Challenge Went (Summary):
  - It went well. My team and I discussed options and chose one swiftly. After we chose the option, we got to work by generating ideas and taking inspiration from
    other puzzle games. Learning how to use C# in unity to create this game will most likely be our biggest obstacle to face but I believe we will be able to do it.
    We have officially started development of the game and I just created the playable character so I believe we are doing quite well.
