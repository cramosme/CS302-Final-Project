  Report:
    This challenge went well. My team and I were able to brainstorm about the game and made decent progress with our idea. We have a list of potential puzzles and have even started rough sketches of some of the assets of the game. We are
    very excited to be using Unity and are excited to make a fully functional game, even though we've seen how challenging it might be when experimenting with scripts.
