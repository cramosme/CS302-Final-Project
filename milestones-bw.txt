Report of How This Challenge Went (Summary):
  - I actually feel like it was quite productive. We have a good direction for where we want our project to head/end up and I am beginning
    to learn Unity. Unity feels rather complicated but it actually looks like it will be a lot of fun to learn how to use. Overall, we have developed a puzzle idea
    and began to create an environment so I am happy with where we are.
